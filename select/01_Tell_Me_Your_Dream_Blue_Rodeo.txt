As we sat in front of that August moon
You said the clouds they look like they have wings
Sometimes I wonder if you can read my mind
Cause I was thinking the very same thing
When I'm with you all the stars shine through
My heart opens like a morning flower
You know I'd leave it all behind
Cause my only peace of mind
Is when I'm here with you
So tell me your dream
Lay your head on my pillow
Tell me the things that you hide away
Your pain
Your pleasure
Your sorrow
Tell me the things that you hide away
Your pain your pleasure your sorrow
