(Come, sweetheart, tell me, now is the time)

You, tell me your, dream
And, I'll tell you, mine

'Cause it was, of you

Come, sweetheart, tell me
Now is the time
You, tell me your, dream
And I (and I) will tell (will tell) you mine
You, tell me your, dream
And I (and I) will tell (will tell) you mine
