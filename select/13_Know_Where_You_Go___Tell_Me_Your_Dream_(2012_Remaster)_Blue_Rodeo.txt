Nothing can compare
To how I feel
When I'm by your side
And nothing can compare
To the world
I see in your eyes

'Cause I know where you go
Love how you know
How to take me there
Yea I know where you go
Love how you know
How to take me there

You fill my head
With colours
Of wonder and delight
You move across my mind
Like the dance
Of the Northern Lights

'Cause I know where you go
Love how you know
How to take me there
Yea I know where you go
Love how you know
How to take me there

As we sat in front of that August moon
You said the clouds they look like angel wings
Sometimes I wonder if you can read my mind
'Cause I was thinking the very same thing

When I'm with you all the stars shine through
My heart opens up like a morning flower
You know I'd leave it all behind
'Cause my only peace of mind
Is when I'm here with you

So tell me your dream
Lay your head on my pillow
Tell me the things that you hide away
Your pain
Your pleasure
Your sorrow
Tell me the things that you hide away
Your pain
Your pleasure
Your sorrow
