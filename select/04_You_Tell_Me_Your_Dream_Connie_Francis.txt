You had a dream dear I had one too
Mine was the best dream because it was of you
Come sweetheart tell me now is the time
You tell me your dream I'll tell you mine

You had a dream dear I had one too
Mine was the best dream because it was of you
Come sweetheart tell me now is the time
You tell me your dream I'll tell you mine

You tell me your dream I'll tell you mine
